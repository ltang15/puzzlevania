In the land of Puzzlevania, Aaron, Bob, and Charlie had an argument over which one of them was the greatest puzzler of all time. 
To end the argument once and for all, they agreed on a duel to the death. Aaron is a poor shooter and only hits his target with a probability of 1/3. 
Bob is a bit better and hits his target with a probability of 1/2. Charlie is an expert marksman and never misses. 
A hit means a kill and the person hit drops out of the duel. 
To compensate for the inequities in their marksmanship skills, it is decided that the contestants would fire in turns starting with Aaron, followed by Bob, and then by Charlie.
The cycle would repeat until there was one man standing. And that man would be remembered as the greatest puzzler of all time.
